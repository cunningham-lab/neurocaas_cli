# Bare bones CLI for interacting with NeuroCAAS. 

Designed to be as simple as possible, this CLI does the bare minimum necessary to interact with NeuroCAAS. In particular, it has two functions: 

1. Register user info necessary to interact with NeuroCAAS via AWS. 
2. Analyze data located on a local computer with NeuroCAAS. 

Instructions: 

1. Sign up for a NeuroCAAS account, and locate relevant credential information. 
2. Then, install and configure the AWS CLI and this tool. 
3. Locate data and config files you would like to use. 
4. Upload data and config files to NeuroCAAS
5. Analyze your data. 

Ongoing todos: 
- [ ] Incorporate Joao's automatic credentialing system. 
- [ ] Make this repo a template for others to use.
